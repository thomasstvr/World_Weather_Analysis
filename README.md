# World Weather Analysis
The purpose of this repository is to create a beta that combs through the current, worldwide, weather and recommends travel destinations for our application’s users. The user inputs a temperature range into the code and the code then sorts a randomized list of cities in order to recommend a destination.

Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap API’s were used to retrieve weather data and build maps based on this data.

## Results 
With the users input of 60-85*F, we had a list of 310 possible cities to visit. The first map below shows a pin map of these possible destinations.

Once a destination was chosen, a travel itinerary was created. Below, you can see a pin map and a directions map of this itinerary.

## Summary
In summary, API’s can be used to retrieve data from websites such as Google and OpenWeatherMaps in order to be sorted and used at one’s disposal. In our case, we chose to use them to recommend and plan a vacation for our users. Once this beta version is approved, we will map every city in the world to the program.
